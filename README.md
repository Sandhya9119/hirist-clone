## A glimpse of the project and a simple walkthrough of the website:

### Landing Page :-

This is how the landing page looks like when the user visits the website for the first time. We have used hover effects and Javascript functionality across this page to navigate to various types of jobs and also included the search functionality for available jobs and also the option for the user to sign in or sign up to the website.
